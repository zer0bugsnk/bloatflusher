**ADB Bloatware Flusher** is a simple but powerful Python tool that lets you safely uninstall unwanted apps (bloatware) from any Android device using ADB â€” all without rooting.

Remove the clutter. Reclaim your device.

Why BloatFlusher?
Because most Android devices come packed with apps you donâ€™t need â€” using up space, draining battery, and cluttering your system. BloatFlusher gives you a clean, simple way to remove them safely using ADB â€” no root, no fuss, just control.
